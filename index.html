<h2>We specialize in:</h2>
<ul>

<li>
<h3 id="vrf">VRF (variable refrigerant flow) heating and cooling systems</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Instead of traditional HVAC systems, Eclipse focuses on VRF systems for their
energy-saving potential. We have worked on these systems since 2008, when we
installed a VRF system in the First National Plaza building in Cloquet. This
job was part of a research project by Minnesota Power, and was one of the first
installations of such a system in the state. You can <a
href="https://minnesotapower.blob.core.windows.net/content/Content/Documents/EnergyConservation/Business/CustomerProfiles/vrfz.pdf">read
Minnesota Power’s Research Profile on this VRF system here</a>. To see how
Eclipse can help you with installation or maintenance of a VRF system, please

<h3 id="painting">
Painting, both interior and exterior, with color-matching capabilities
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Using Benjamin Moore’s Gennex Color Technology, we are able to do a precise
scan of an existing color sample, mix our own paint with our in-house tinting
machine, and produce the right amount of paint needed for your custom job. <a
href="#contact">Contact us</a> if you have a paint job you need done
professionally.

</ul>

<h3 id="cnc">
CNC services, including custom cabinetry, architectural detailing, and more
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
With our ShopSabre industrial CNC router, we can cut woods, plastics, and other
materials up to 4’x8’ in size. Computer numerical control allows us to make
cuts with extreme precision and reliability. Whether its a one-off custom job,
or an order of 100s of the the same part, <a href="#contact">contact us</a> to
see how our CNC team can cut your pieces quickly and accurately.

Some of our recent projects include:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Eclipse installed a new VRF system in Minnesota Power’s Cloquet office
building, replacing an old and ineffective HVAC system. The project was
highlighted by Mitsubishi Electric as a case study, you can <a
href="https://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/case-studies/minnesota-power">read more
here.</a>
</li>
<br>
<li>
Eclipse was contacted by Black Woods to repair the Greysolon Plaza’s Ballroom
after a wall was damaged by steam. We constructed a new wall to replace one
that was destroyed, color-matched the existing paint to touch up damaged areas,
and even 3D scanned and carved out replicas of the plaster decorations to match
the rest of the room.  (Pics?)
</li>
<br>
<li>
Eclipse has worked with Sadi’s Smoke Shops in Cloquet, Duluth, and Hibbing to
build display cabinetry, paint new spaces, and construct custom countertops.
